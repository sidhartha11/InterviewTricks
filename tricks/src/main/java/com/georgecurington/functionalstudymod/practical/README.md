### This package is meant for those so-called practical work related coding tests ###
For example, a recruiter recently ask a developer the following question:
I have a web site that needs to audit all successful logins to a database. 
It takes n milliseconds to log the information to the database. There a millions 
of logins a day. I do not wish for this to impact the client using the web site.
In other words , how can this be handled without impacting user experience in some way.
The recruitor went on to say, you will be given a method that will log the message.
How will you write this method so as to not impact the running system too much?
### Get the general idea ? ###
This package will try to put a few real world coding exersizes .. NOT THE SILLY MATH stuff.
