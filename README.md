# InterviewTricks
Decided To Store Various Trick Coding Exercises That Interviewers Try To Trick You With :) 
Well, there are various trick coding interview questions that interviewers always try to 
trip up Java Programmers with. Most of the coding questions are useless in the real world.
However, since it is popular among various companies to ask such useless coding exercizes 
I decided to collect as many of them that I hear about and place them here in this repository.
Feel free to contribute by making a pull request. If I think it deems worthy I will put in the 
repository and put your name as the contributor. 
## NOTE: items marked with a ++  have been implemented but not transferred to the git repo yet.
## I will try to keep of list of what I have put here thus far:
1. find all pairs in an array that sum up to some input number. 
2. fibanacci
3. factorial
4. various types of sorts and searches.
5. find all triplets in an array that sum up to some input number.
6. find the n largest elements at anypoint in time of an infinite flowing stream of elements. Approach O(log n) time complexity.
7. various ways to reverse a string other than the obvious way,i.e. in O(n/2) time complexity.
8. Look up a number in a list and return all repeated instances of that number. Attempt to approach O(logn) time complexity.
9. Create a home grown version of a simple linked list.
10. Implement both a stack and a queue using the home grown linked list in (9).
11. Implement both a stack and a queue using Java's linked list. 
12. Implement a simple binary tree.
13. Implement the following tree traversals: inorder , preorder , postorder, breadthfirst depthfirst.
14. Use the visitor pattern to process the nodes in the traversals of ( 13 ). 
15. Implement a binary search
16. Implement a quick sort algorithm
17. Bubble Sort 
18. Merge Sort 
19. Selection sort ++
20. Experimental external merge sort ++
21. anagram finder
22. palandrom finder
23. reverse string method in O(n/2) time complexity; includes recursive example O(n) complexity
24. remove duplicates from a sorted array: 1.Iterative , 2. Inplace , 3. Recursive  
25. Linked list: insertAtHead, insertAtEnd, insertAtMiddle, insertSorted algorithms 
26. Linked list: deleteNode algorithms 
27. Find 2 elements that are maximum distance apart int array. (Test used at Amazon) 
28. Find the missing number in an integer array. 
29. Simulation: RestService call logging successful logins to database without waiting for response from DB
30. Various examples from "Mastering Lambdas, Java Programming in a Multicore World" 

## started adding a collection of Design Patterns implemented in Java.

thus far:
1. visitor pattern
2. factory method pattern
3. singleton pattern
4. strategy pattern
5. decorator pattern 

## Misc Thread Related Exercises fully documented( will add soon )
1. various chapters from Concurrency In Practice by Brian Goetz are examined in detail.
2. Added some jkd8 lambda features to some of the Concurrency In Practice examples.
3. Created an Experiment Concurrent Sorting Class. It uses Callbles, Queues, etc to sort large input.

# and so on and so on.
