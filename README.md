Decided To Store Various Trick Coding Exercises That Interviewers Try To Trick You With :) 
Well, there are various trick coding interview questions that interviewers always try to 
trip up Java Programmers with. Most of the coding questions are useless in the real world.
However, since it is popular among various companies to ask such useless coding exercizes 
I decided to collect as many of them that I hear about and place them here in this repository.
Feel free to contribute by making a pull request. If I think it deems worthy I will put in the 
repository and put your name as the contributor.
Here are a few examples:
1. find all pairs in an array that sum up to some input number. 
2. fibanacci 
3. factorial
4. various types of sorts and searches.
# and so on and so on.
