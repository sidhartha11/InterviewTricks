# InterviewTricks
# Decided to store various types of exercises that fall under the following categories:
1.	Trick questions that my friends tell me about.
2.	Common algorithms, linkedlist,queue, tree, trie/suffix trees, sorts, searches
3.	Numerical algorithms that commonly pop up as Trick interview questions
4.	JDK8 Lambda examples
5.	Many examples are documented and illustrated from the seminal , yet old , book "Concurrency In Practice". I have tried add JDK8 lambda expressions to the examples wherever possible.
6.	Numerical Summing Trick Questions: Number pairs in a set that sum up to some n; Subset Sum Problem; etc etc 

CONTRIBUTE! CONTRIBUTE!
Feel free to offer pull requests. If I like your request I will add it to my repository noting your contribution. I'll pay special attention to any Dynamic programming examples or any experimental Trie algorithms you might know about. 

## NOTE: items marked with a ++  have been implemented but not transferred to the git repo yet.
## I will try to keep of list of what I have put here thus far:
1. find all pairs in an array that sum up to some input number. 
2. fibanacci
3. factorial
4. various types of sorts and searches.
5. find all triplets in an array that sum up to some input number.
6. find the n largest elements at anypoint in time of an infinite flowing stream of elements. Approach O(log n) time complexity.
7. various ways to reverse a string other than the obvious way,i.e. in O(n/2) time complexity.
8. Look up a number in a list and return all repeated instances of that number. Attempt to approach O(logn) time complexity.
9. Create a home grown version of a simple linked list.
10. Implement both a stack and a queue using the home grown linked list in (9).
11. Implement both a stack and a queue using Java's linked list. 
12. Implement a simple binary tree.
13. Implement the following tree traversals: inorder , preorder , postorder, breadthfirst depthfirst.
14. Use the visitor pattern to process the nodes in the traversals of ( 13 ). 
15. Implement a binary search
16. Implement a quick sort algorithm
17. Bubble Sort 
18. Merge Sort 
19. Selection sort ++
20. Experimental external merge sort ++
21. anagram finder
22. palandrom finder
23. reverse string method in O(n/2) time complexity; includes recursive example O(n) complexity
24. remove duplicates from a sorted array: 1.Iterative , 2. Inplace , 3. Recursive  
25. Linked list: insertAtHead, insertAtEnd, insertAtMiddle, insertSorted algorithms 
26. Linked list: deleteNode algorithms 
27. Find 2 elements that are maximum distance apart int array. (Test used at Amazon) 
28. Find the missing number in an integer array. 
29. Simulation: RestService call logging successful logins to database without waiting for response from DB
30. Various examples from "Mastering Lambdas, Java Programming in a Multicore World" 
31. Simple Matrix Dot Multiplication example ( TODO -- multi-threaded approach to Matrix Multiplication ) 
32. Simple Generic Trie Tree Implementation. Feel Free to contribute.
33. SUBSET SUM PROBLEM: Simple Dynamic Programming Implementation. 
34. Find all pairs in a SORTED array that add up to some number.

## started adding a collection of Design Patterns implemented in Java.

thus far:
1. visitor pattern
2. factory method pattern
3. singleton pattern
4. strategy pattern
5. decorator pattern 

## Misc Thread Related Exercises fully documented( will add soon )
1. various chapters from Concurrency In Practice by Brian Goetz are examined in detail.
2. Added some jkd8 lambda features to some of the Concurrency In Practice examples.
3. Created an Experiment Concurrent Sorting Class. It uses Callbles, Queues, etc to sort large input.

# and so on and so on.
