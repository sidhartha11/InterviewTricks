# InterviewTricks
Decided To Store Various Trick Coding Exercises That Interviewers Try To Trick You With :) 
Well, there are various trick coding interview questions that interviewers always try to 
trip up Java Programmers with. Most of the coding questions are useless in the real world.
However, since it is popular among various companies to ask such useless coding exercizes 
I decided to collect as many of them that I hear about and place them here in this repository.
Feel free to contribute by making a pull request. If I think it deems worthy I will put in the 
repository and put your name as the contributor. 
## NOTE: items marked with a ++  have been implemented but not transferred to the git repo yet.
## I will try to keep of list of what I have put here thus far:
1. find all pairs in an array that sum up to some input number. 
2. fibanacci ++
3. factorial ++
4. various types of sorts and searches.
5. find all triplets in an array that sum up to some input number.
6. find the n largest elements at anypoint in time of an infinite flowing stream of elements. Approach O(log n) time complexity.
7. various ways to reverse a string other than the obvious way,i.e. in O(n/2) time complexity.
8. Look up a number in a list and return all repeated instances of that number. Attempt to approach O(logn) time complexity.
9. Create a home grown version of a simple linked list.
10. Implement both a stack and a queue using the home grown linked list in (9).
11. Implement both a stack and a queue using Java's linked list. 
12. Implement a simple binary tree.
13. Implement the following tree traversals: inorder , preorder , postorder, breadthfirst depthfirst.
14. Use the visitor pattern to process the nodes in the traversals of ( 13 ). 
15. Implement a binary search
16. Implement a quick sort algorithm
17. Bubble Sort ++
18. Merge Sort ++
19. Selection sort ++
20. Experimental external merge sort ++


# and so on and so on.
